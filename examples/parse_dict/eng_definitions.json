It is a traditional Chinese system of counting. Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches are collectively known as \"Stem-Branch\".\n\nThe 10 Heavenly Stems are 甲(gaap3) 乙(jyut6) 丙(bing2) 丁(ding1) 戊(mou6) 己(gei2) 庚(gang1) 辛(san1) 壬(jam4) 癸(gwai3).\n\nThe 12 Earthly Branches are 子(zi2) 丑(cau2) 寅(jan4) 卯(maau5) 辰(san4) 巳(zi6) 午(ng5) 未(mei6) 申(san1) 酉(jau5) 戌(seot1) 亥(hoi6). Each Heavenly Stem is paired with an Earthly Branch to form the \"stem-branch\" sexagenary (i.e. 60 element) cycle that starts with 甲子 (gaap3 zi2)\n\nThe sexagenary cycle is often used for counting years in the Chinese calendar. Heavenly Stems are also used independently to name things in a particular order -- the first is labeled \"gaap3\", the second \"jyut6\", the third \"bing2\", and so on. It is similar to how \"A, B, C\" and \"α, β, γ\" are used in western cultures. Earthly Branches are also traditionally used to denote time.
